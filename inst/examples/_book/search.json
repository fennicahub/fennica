    "text": "1 Preface chapter\nIt is imperative to underscore that this bookdown project is an evolving work-in-progress, and several additional fields will be incorporated into the dataset as they undergo the rigorous processes of data cleaning and harmonization.\nWithin the FIN-CLARIAH Metadata Harmonization and Analysis work package, we leverage the Finnish national bibliography (FNB) Fennica dataset to develop a harmonized dataset, serving research purposes and laying the groundwork for further infrastructure iterations. The project’s outcomes will be instrumental in supporting the DHL-FI project funded by the Research Council of Finland. The FNB encompasses metadata for over a million documents, including books, newspapers, maps, etc., with records spanning from 1488 to the present. For more details about Fennica, visit The National Finnish Library website.\nCurrently, the bookdown project comprises a few distinct chapters. Notably, the harmonization process has been executed through the establishment of dual pipelines: Complete FNB Pipeline and 1809 to 1917 Period Pipeline These chapters are dedicated to the specific metadata categories.\nHow to reproduce the workflow",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nMARC: 041,a\nThe polish_languages function is designed to standardize and harmonize language information in a dataset. The process starts by isolating unique language entries, ensuring that each distinct combination of languages is processed only once, which improves efficiency and avoids redundant computations. A MARC reference list of recognized language abbreviations and names is then used to map language codes to their standardized forms. Each language entry is analyzed to identify multiple languages and to detect any unrecognized terms.\nThe entries are standardized by converting them to their recognized forms while eliminating duplicates and filtering out unrecognized languages. Empty cells in the dataset are marked as NA to indicate missing information. Once standardized, all valid languages are aggregated to create a structured data frame. This data frame includes the total number of languages in each entry, a flag (TRUE/FALSE) indicating whether the entry contains multiple languages (including those that are originally coded as mul = Multiple language), the cleaned and harmonized list of languages, and the primary language, which is defined as the first listed language in each entry. The result is a cleaned and standardized dataset that facilitates accurate analysis of multilingual data.\nAdditionally, an error list is generated, consisting of unrecognized language information and the corresponding IDs. This error list helps librarians identify mistakes in the original data and provides context to either correct the errors or explain why certain entries were discarded by the function.",

    "text": "3.1 Complete Data Overview\nMARC field: 008/07-14\nThe publication years section offers a comprehensive summary of the dataset’s years of publication, providing an understanding of the temporal distribution of titles. The inclusion of links to uniquely accepted and discarded output tables adds a layer of transparency, allowing for detailed exploration of the refined and excluded data.\nData harmonization was performed using the polish_years function, originally developed to clean and refine publication time data from the 362a field, which contained numerous symbols requiring conversion for readability and statistical analysis. Although publication years are now extracted from the much cleaner 008 field, the function performs effectively on this field as well, eliminating the need to develop a new one.\nThe polish_years function processes and harmonizes temporal data, splitting it into columns such as publication_year, publication_from, publication_till (for serials), and publication_decade (for visualization). Links to the converted data are provided below.\nThe dataset includes information on missing values, represented as NA in the refined data. There are 12 empty rows in the field 008. Discarded values, such as invalid entries coded as characters (e.g., “uuuu”, “||||”) or inconsistent data (e.g., years beyond the current year or mismatched date ranges), are excluded. This does not imply that the discarded values are incorrect; rather, they are excluded because they cannot be utilized for statistical analysis.\nThe summary also accounts for publication statuses (field 008/06). For accurate temporal distribution, these statuses and their implications must be carefully considered to ensure only valid dates are selected that represent the publication year and not something else.\nPublication year conversions\nPublication year discarded. 801 records are discarded where the publication date is not coded or unknown or contain ambiguous dates, such as non-numeric characters.
