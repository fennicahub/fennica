# Preface chapter

It is imperative to underscore that this bookdown project is an evolving **work-in-progress**, and several additional fields will be incorporated into the dataset as they undergo the rigorous processes of data cleaning and harmonization.

Within the [DARIAH-FI](https://www.dariah.fi/) and [FIN-CLARIAH](https://www.kielipankki.fi/organization/fin-clariah/) Metadata Harmonization and Analysis work package, we leverage the Finnish national bibliography (FNB) Fennica dataset to develop a harmonized dataset, serving research purposes and laying the groundwork for further infrastructure iterations. The project's outcomes will be instrumental in supporting the [DHL-FI](https://sites.utu.fi/digital-history-literature-finland/) project funded by the Research Council of Finland. The FNB encompasses metadata for over a million documents, including books, newspapers, maps, etc., with records spanning from 1488 to the present. For more details about Fennica, visit The National Finnish Library [website](https://www.kansalliskirjasto.fi/en/services/fennica-finnish-national-bibliography).

Currently, the bookdown project comprises a few distinct chapters. Notably, the harmonization process has been executed through the establishment of dual pipelines: **Complete FNB Pipeline** and **1809 to 1917 Period Pipeline** These chapters are dedicated to the specific metadata categories.
